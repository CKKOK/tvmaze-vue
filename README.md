# TVMaze-Vue!

This repo contains a re-do of the [TVMaze-React exercise](https://github.com/CKKOK/tvmaze-react), a simple front-end search interface for the TVMaze API as a Single Page Application with infinite scroll on results from an empty query. The exercise was originally done using React. The creation of this exercise was used in learning the VueJS 2.0 framework.

With class-based components and Web Component usage via template/slot, VueJS seems to strike a balance betwen React's and Angular's development model.
